Project Description
In this project, a multiple linear regression model was applied to predict housing prices. The model uses key features such as the number of rooms, number of bathrooms, and square footage (living area).

The dataset is structured to distinguish between basement level and above-ground level features. In the initial phase, a model was built using only the above-ground level data. Later, features related to the basement were also included in the dataset and the model was retrained.

Comparative analysis showed that basement features have a significant impact on housing prices. This finding highlights the importance of including basement-related data when performing housing valuation and resulted in improved model performance.

First Model: Used only above-ground features:
"GrLivArea", "BedroomAbvGr", "FullBath", "HalfBath", and the target variable "SalePrice".

Second Model: Included both above-ground and basement features:
"GrLivArea", "BedroomAbvGr", "FullBath", "HalfBath", "TotalBsmtSF", "BsmtFullBath", "BsmtHalfBath", and "SalePrice".

What is Linear Regression?
Linear regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a linear equation.

ùë¶=ùëè0+ùëè1ùë•+ùúÄ
y : Dependent variable
x: Independent variable
ùëè0 : Intercept
ùëè1 : Slope
Œµ : Error term
When is it Used?
When there is a linear relationship between variables
When you want to predict future values
When you want to understand cause-effect relationships
When data is limited but interpretability is important
Use Cases:
Economics: House price prediction

Healthcare: Relationship between age and blood pressure

Education: Exam score analysis

Marketing: Ad budget vs sales

Simple vs Multiple Regression:
Simple regression: One independent variable

Multiple regression: More than one independent variable

What is RMSE?
RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) is a commonly used performance metric for evaluating regression models. It measures the average magnitude of the error between the predicted values and the actual values.

Definition:
RMSE is the square root of the average of the squared differences between the predicted values and the actual values.

Interpretation:
The lower the RMSE, the better the model‚Äôs predictions match the actual values.

Since RMSE retains the units of the target variable, it is easy to interpret (e.g., in currency for house prices).

RMSE is sensitive to outliers due to the squaring of errors, which gives more weight to larger errors.

In Summary:
RMSE provides a numerical estimate of how well a regression model performs. A lower RMSE value indicates a more accurate model.
